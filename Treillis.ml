(*\fn widen
  \val widen : Cil_types.kernel_function -> Cil_types.stmt -> state -> state -> state
  \details widen h t1 t2 is an over-approximation of join t1 t2. Assumes is_included t1 t2
 *)


(*\fn narrow
  \val narrow : state -> state -> state Eval.or_bottom
  \details Over-approximation of the intersection of two abstract states (called meet in the literature).
  Used only to gain some precision when interpreting the complete behaviors of a function specification.
  Can be very imprecise without impeding the analysis: meet x y = `Value x is always sound.
